\label{sec:conclusionandfuturework}
	In this project a proof-of-concept (PoC) system for indicating current real-time CO$_2$ emission levels to elevator users was implemented.
	This was done with the purpose of changing behavior in people, to make them want to take the stairs, when CO$_2$ emissions are high. 

	The PoC system functions as intended, being able to fetch current CO$_2$ emission data from the Internet, and presenting it in a semantically easy to understand way to the user.
	The system has yet to be deployed in a real-life situation, to test its impact on human behavior.

	Some issues remain to be tackled before a final version can be deployed:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
			A better model for seasonal trends in CO$_2$ emission needs to be developed in order to ultimately make the information provided truly useful.

		\item
			As of this writing, the middle-ware used by the application does not allow for radio acknowledgments to be passed to the application.
			This results in a communication overhead from excess retransmissions needed to ensure an appropriate Quality of Service.

		\item 
			A thorough analysis of power consumption in the battery powered end device is needed to guarantee sufficient battery life.

	\end{itemize}
