	Multiple studies have shown that a reduction in electricity consumption can be achieved by providing the end-user with information such as electricity cost and CO$_2$ emission\cite{Tricascade:2009:Online}. 
	This report describes a mini-project made in the Internet of Things course at Aarhus University School of Engineering. 
	The purpose of the mini-project is to implement a system that can provide the users of an elevator with an indication of current CO$_2$ emissions caused by the electricity production needed to power the elevator. 
	An LED device placed on the elevator will blink red during high emission and green during low emission. 
	Thereby the users are encouraged to consider taking the stairs when the LED is blinking red.
