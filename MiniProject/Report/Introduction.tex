\label{sec:introduction}
Multiple studies have shown that a reduction in electricity consumption can be achieved by providing the end-user with information such as electricity cost and $CO_2$ emission\cite{tricascade}. 
This report describes a mini-project made in the Internet of Things course at Aarhus University School of Engineering. 
The purpose of the mini-project is to implement a system that can provide end-users with information about current $CO_2$ emissions. 
The information is meant to encourage the users to consider reducing electricity consumption in periods of high $CO_2$ emission.
