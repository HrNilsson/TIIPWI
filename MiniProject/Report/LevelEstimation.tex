\subsection{CO$_2$ Level Estimation} % (fold)
\label{sub:co__2_level_estimation}

	In order to give the user feedback on whether the current CO$_2$ emission level is \emph{HIGH} or \emph{LOW} you need two pieces of information.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data on CO$_2$ emission levels
		\item Knowledge of what constitutes a \emph{HIGH} or \emph{LOW} emission level
	\end{itemize}

	The available data is described in Section \ref{sub:c02_emission_data}.
	For this project it is elected to use the \emph{online} data, as this fits our use case best.
	Firstly, because \emph{prognosis} data about future levels are not very useful for a user, as people are unlikely to postpone the use of the elevator, even with the knowledge of any potential savings from doing so.
	Secondly,
